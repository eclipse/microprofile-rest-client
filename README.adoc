# Rest Client for MicroProfile

== Rationale

The MicroProfile Rest Client provides a type-safe approach to invoke RESTful services over HTTP.  As much as possible the
MP Rest Client attempts to use link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/2.1/[Jakarta RESTful Web Services 2.1] APIs for consistency and easier re-use.

== Example

Here is an example - let's say that you want to use a movie review service.  The remote service might provide APIs to view
users' reviews and allow you to post and modify your own reviews.  You might start with an interface to represent the remote
service like this:
```java
 @Path("/movies")
 public interface MovieReviewService {
     @GET
     Set<Movie> getAllMovies();

     @GET
     @Path("/{movieId}/reviews")
     Set<Review> getAllReviews( @PathParam("movieId") String movieId );

     @GET
     @Path("/{movieId}/reviews/{reviewId}")
     Review getReview( @PathParam("movieId") String movieId, @PathParam("reviewId") String reviewId );

     @POST
     @Path("/{movieId}/reviews")
     String submitReview( @PathParam("movieId") String movieId, Review review );

     @PUT
     @Path("/{movieId}/reviews/{reviewId}")
     Review updateReview( @PathParam("movieId") String movieId, @PathParam("reviewId") String reviewId, Review review );
 }
```

Now we can use this interface as a means to invoke the actual remote review service like this:
```java
URI apiUri = new URI("http://localhost:9080/movieReviewService");
MovieReviewService reviewSvc = RestClientBuilder.newBuilder()
            .baseUri(apiUri)
            .build(MovieReviewService.class);
Review review = new Review(3 /* stars */, "This was a delightful comedy, but not terribly realistic.");
reviewSvc.submitReview( movieId, review );
```

This allows for a much more natural coding style, and the underlying MicroProfile implementation handles the communication
between the client and service - it makes the HTTP connection, serializes the Review object to JSON/XML/etc. so that the
remote service can process it.
