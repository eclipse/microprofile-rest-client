/**
 * This is a provider interface intended for intercepting asynchronous method invocations. Registered implementations of
 * this interface will be invoked to build a new <code>AsyncInvocationInterceptor</code>. This interceptor would then be
 * invoked before and after swapping threads for an asynchronous client invocation.
 *
 * The priority of this provider determines when the factory's <code>newInterceptor</code> method will be invoked - but
 * also the <code>AsyncInvocationInterceptor</code>'s lifecycle methods as well. Like other providers, the priority is
 * ascending (where a provider with priority 1 will execute before a provider of priority 2), however, the interceptors'
 * <code>applyContext</code> methods will be invoked in descending order. The priority of the provider can be specified
 * using the <code>javax.annotation.Priority</code> annotation or when registering the provider using the
 * <code>RestClientBuilder</code>.
 *
 * The timing of when providers of this interface is invoked relative to other providers (such as filters, entity
 * interceptors, etc.) is undefined. Implementations of this or the <code>AsyncInvocationInterceptor</code> interface
 * should not rely on the order of other providers, as this could change between different implementations of the MP
 * Rest Client.
