/**
 * APIs to aid in CDI-based injection of MP Rest Client implementations. These annotations are used both to mark an
 * interface as registered Rest Client and also to designate that an implementation of that interface should be injected
 * at a specific injection point.
 *
 * Example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#064;RegisterProvider
 * &#064;Dependent
 * public interface MyClientService {
 *     &#064;GET
 *     &#064;Path("/myService/{id}")
 *     Widget getWidget(&#064;PathParam("id") String id);
 * }
 *
 * ...
 * &#064;ApplicationScoped
 * public class MyBean {
 *     &#064;Inject
 *     &#064;RestClient
 *     MyClientService service;
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
