/**
 * This interface is intended for generating or propagating HTTP headers. It is invoked by the MP Rest Client
 * implementation before invoking any entity providers on the outbound processing chain. It contains a single method,
 * <code>update</code> which takes parameters of headers passed in from the incoming JAX-RS request (if applicable, if
 * not, this will be an empty map) and a read-only map of headers specified by <code>ClientHeaderParam</code> or
 * <code>HeaderParam</code> annotations on the client interface.
 * <p>
 * This method should return a MultivaluedMap of headers to be merged with the outgoing headers. If it's desired for
 * {@code clientOutgoingHeaders} to be present in addition to any propagated headers,
 * {@link #update(MultivaluedMap, MultivaluedMap) update} needs to combine the two sets to return. This will determine
 * the final set of HTTP headers that will be sent to the outbound entity provider processing chain - thus any filters,
 * MessageBodyWriters, interceptors, etc. could further refine the set of headers actually sent on the client request.
 * <p>
 * If the ClientHeadersFactory instance is invoked while in the context of a JAX-RS request, the implementation may
 * optionally support injection of fields and methods annotated with <code>{@literal @}Context</code>.
 * <p>
 * If the ClientHeadersFactory instance is managed by CDI (i.e. it is annotated with
 * <code>{@literal @}ApplicationScoped</code>, etc.), the implementation must use the appropriate CDI-managed instance,
 * and must support <code>{@literal @}Inject</code> injection.
